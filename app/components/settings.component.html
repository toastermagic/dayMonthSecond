      The mango is a juicy stone fruit belonging to the genus Mangifera, consisting of numerous tropical fruiting trees, cultivated
      mostly for edible fruit. The majority of these species are found in nature as wild mangoes. They all belong to the
      flowering plant family Anacardiaceae. The mango is native to South and Southeast Asia, from where it has been distributed
      worldwide to become one of the most cultivated fruits in the tropics.

      The highest concentration of Mangifera genus is in the western part of Malesia (Sumatra, Java and Borneo) and in Burma and
      India. While other Mangifera species (e.g. horse mango, M. foetida) are also grown on a more localized basis, Mangifera
      indica&mdash;the "common mango" or "Indian mango"&mdash;is the only mango tree commonly cultivated in many tropical
      and subtropical regions.

      It originated in Indian subcontinent (present day India and Pakistan) and Burma. It is the national fruit of India, Pakistan,
      and the Philippines, and the national tree of Bangladesh. In several cultures, its fruit and leaves are ritually used
      as floral decorations at weddings, public celebrations, and religious ceremonies.
